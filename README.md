# EcoScan - Clothing Carbon Footprint Scanner üåø

* EcoScan is a web application designed to help users understand the environmental impact of their clothing choices. By analyzing images of clothing items, the app calculates their carbon footprint, awards eco-reward points, and showcases redeemable offers for sustainable actions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features üöÄ

A. Frontend:

1. Upload images via file or directly capture using a camera.
2. View detailed analysis:
3. Identified clothing items.
4. Estimated carbon scores.
5. Total eco-reward points via eco-savings quiz.
6. Browse and redeem available offers.

B. Backend:

1. Image Analysis: Recognizes clothing items and estimates their carbon footprint.
2. Carbon Score Calculation: Determines scores based on in-memory assumptions.
3. Offer Management: Displays offers based on eco-reward points.
